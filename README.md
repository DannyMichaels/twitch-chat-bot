# twitch-chat-bot

has a text to speech command with npm "say" package!
check TwitchChatBot.js


also added a run.sh script to open a view that generates auth code and runs the bot.
(did that so we don't have to open the url and get the authorization code and put it in process.env over and over again when restarting the script)
